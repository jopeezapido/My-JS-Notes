Recursion

We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

 Zero is even.

 One is odd.

 For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.

Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

Hint: 

Your function will likely look somewhat similar to the inner find function in the recursive findSolution example in this chapter, with an if/else if/else chain that tests which of the three cases applies. The final else, corresponding to the third case, makes the recursive call. Each of the branches should contain a return statement or in some other way arrange for a specific value to be returned.

When given a negative number, the function will recurse again and again, passing itself an ever more negative number, thus getting further and further away from returning a result. It will eventually run out of stack space and abort.
